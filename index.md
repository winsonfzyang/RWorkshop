This is a two-day hands on workshop based on the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). You will learn how to visualize, transform, and model data in R and work with date-times, character strings, and untidy data formats. Along the way, you will learn and use many packages from the tidyverse including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, lubridate, and forcats.

As I know everyone is busy with work, research, and classes, this workshop is not meant to teach you the basics of R, but to share some best practices in running statistical analysis in R. Hence if you want to learn more foundational R programming, please check out the pre-workshop notes to get started. However, the pre-workshop notes are not as comprehensive as the book; I extract the most fundamental elements that is most commonly used for this workshop.
