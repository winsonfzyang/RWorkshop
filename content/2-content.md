### Day 0: Preparation
Day 0 is meant to introduce the various data types we will be working on during the workshop. It is not meant to be the to-go area if you wish to learn the very basic foundation of coding in R. However, this will get you going with more hands-on work and allow you to be familiar with the workshop content.

### Day 1: Data Wrangling
Day 1 introduces you to the basics of loading and manipulating your data with the tidyverse collection. We will go through several functions, such as `read_csv()`, `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `rename()`. The list is not exhaustive and we do not have time to go through all the functions. Hence it is up to you to learn more about tidyverse after this workshop.

### Day 2: Data Visualization with ggplot
For this section, we will focus on the grammar of ggplot, creating basic plots, making custom plots, and setting custom themes. This is where you can get creative with your colors, themes, settings, etc. Show your artsy side with ggplot!
